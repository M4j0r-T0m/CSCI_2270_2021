# CSCI_2270_2021
Git Project for CSCI 2270

This is a project that somewhat emulates the process of a git repository, known as minigit. In order for this to compile, one must use g++ -std=c++17 in a
standard Mac or Linux terminal. 

When the program is run, a new directory is created called minigit. After this, a menu with 5 options will be displayed which allowsthe user to 
either: add a file to the directory, remove a file from the directory, commit/make a branch, checkout to a previous commit, or quit the program.
